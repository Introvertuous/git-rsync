## Git Rsync

The purpose of this command line utility is to allow multiple devices to sync up changes within a particular git repository without the need to push and pull commits.

## Commands

- master

- slave

## Remarks

The CLI tries to be as non-destructure as is possible, so when the `slave` needs to become even with the `master`, uncommited changes are stashed.
